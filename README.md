# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `Objective:`

To guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman is drawn. The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or when the hangman is fully drawn.

Setup:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `Hangman Progress:`

Typically, a stick figure representing the hangman is drawn as each incorrect guess is made.
The hangman is usually drawn in a specific sequence (head, body, arms, legs, etc.) for each incorrect guess.
The game ends when the word is guessed correctly (all the letters are filled in) or when the full hangman is drawn.

### `Winning and Losing:`

The guessers win if they successfully guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
